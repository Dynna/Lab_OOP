In first Laboratory I had to familiarize with classes and objects, also with data types.
As I started to do it in PHP I have to mention that in PHP we don't specify the data type 
of a variable when declaring it. Also, it's better to make one class in one file only.
For basic level the condition was to create a program where I can manipulate a monitor 
object which has color, dimensions and resolution. For that you can see basicLevel.php 
and another way of doing it in Monitor.php.

Next I had to Implement a program where I create and modify the 
following objects: university and student. I created students 
that have name, age and mark (from their courses) and universities
which have name, foundationYear and a list of students created earlier. For this
you can see advancedLevel.php and Student.php for another way of doing it with class.
In mainProgram.php I created 3 universities with some students in it and calculated 
the average media between them and printed the result in browser.
